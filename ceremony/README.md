Wedding ceremony
================

This contains the text for the wedding ceremony,
as provided to our officiant.
We put together this ceremony from various sources,
including
[All Seasons](http://allseasonsweddings.com/),
[about.com](http://weddings.about.com/od/yourweddingceremony/a/weddingceremony.htm),
and a bit of our own text.

As with the back of the invitations,
it's provided as LaTeX source,
and can be rendered as a PDF
using `pdflatex`.
