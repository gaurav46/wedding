Wedding invitations
===================

Front
-----

The front was made in Inkscape.
It uses the font REIS,
which is included here for simplicity.

REIS was created by Marcelo Reis Melo.
For more information, see
[his webiste](http://freegoodiesfordesigners.blogspot.se)
or [contact him](mailto:freegoodiesfordesigners@gmail.com).
It is used under a commercial free use license.

Additionally, in the empty space,
we both added a fingerprint in the shape of a heart.
I mean, the two fingerprints together look like a heart.
This can be seen [on the website](http://wedding.bekolay.org/#rsvp).

Back
----

The back was made in LaTeX.
The `.sty` file is based on the NIPS 2014 `.sty` file,
as it seemed to most LaTeX-y.
It was compiled with `pdflatex`,
and can be compiled with
any recent TeX-live distribution.
